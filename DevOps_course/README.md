# Makers Academy - DevOps

Welcome to the first 8 weeks of the rest of your journey to become a DevOps expert...

Every week, either starting from the very beginning or scaffolding with existing material, we'll be building projects and deploying them to the Cloud. Most projects will take one week.

At Makers Academy, we worked hard to figure out what needs to be learned in what order in order to maximise your productivity. The first weeks are designed to give you a foundation in Containers, Serverless and Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD), all of these being very important concepts in modern architectures. The goal is to understand how these work in order to deploy your great applications to the nominated Cloud Provider and bring them live! Alongside these, we will be exploring different (equally important!) configuration and management concepts throughout the weeks.

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Explain what DevOps is and its advantages in the software engineering organisation.
- Explain and navigate modern deployment architectures, to include:
    - Containerisation
    - Observability
    - Continuous Integration and Deployment
    - Infrastructure as Code
    - Container Orchestration
    - Security Awareness
- Build a deployment pipeline using AWS
