# DevOps Day

Here are some guidelines for your end-of-course presentations:

* The time limit is usually 7-10 minutes (this depends on the number of projects, your coach will advise if the time limit is different). Practice, practice, practice to ensure you come in under the time limit. You'll be prompted to wind up your presentations after this time limit!

* If appropriate, make it funny. If not, make it engaging.

* No need to be overly technical. The audience is mainly non-technical and they should be able to understand your description. Don't put up the _Wall of Death_ (the slide that is just library and framework logos).

### What to include?

* To guide you on what to include, think about how far you've gone on your DevOps journey in just 8 weeks. What makes you most proud? Any *eureka* moments throughout your journey?

* How have you worked in teams in the different projects? What practices and rituals have been beneficial? Can you explain how these have helped you achieve a desired objective?

* The idea will be to create a presentation about the **Reliability Project**. What was the challenge that was given to you? What different solutions did you come up with? What did you implement to help the company that hired you? What would you do next if you've had more time?

* Think about the different concepts and skills you've learned and practiced from Week 1 on the DevOps course. What helped you in past weeks to face this Reliability Challenge more confidently?

* Finally, add 1-2 slides showcasing some highlights from the course overall. Think about what you learned in the different weeks and how these fundamentals will help you learn whatever comex next in your future.

* Make it memorable! You should get a great memory out of it :)
