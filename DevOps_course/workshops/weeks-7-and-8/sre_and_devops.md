# SRE and DevOps

The term SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) was coined by Google back in 2003, more precisely it was originated by Benjamin Treynor, VP of Engineering at Google. Broadly speaking, it refers to the practice that adopts the DevOps philosophy. However, we will try and establish some distinctions at some point in this session!


### Learning Objectives
- Understand what is SRE
- Get familiar with the main concepts and definitions related with SRE
- Understand the differences (and similarities) between DevOps and SRE


### SRE compared with DevOps
Once upon a time, Minerva, one of our brilliant business analysts, took part in a meeting in one of her previous companies: Panettone Consulting. She remembers that one of her former colleagues, Fred, an experienced software developer raised something to be discussed during the meeting: "I believe the Ops team could do with releasing features more often." Erika, one of the most experienced members of the Ops team answered: "In fact I believe in the exact opposite of that. By releasing less often, we reduce outages and downtime of our service."

Minerva highlighted this in one of our meetings to convince the team to start adopting some DevOps practices. We have been trying some of these practices and seen some success to a certain extent. However, Albus and Severus decided that it was time to hire, initially, someone for the role of SRE for our team.
