# Introduction to Container Orchestration with Kubernetes

## Learning Objectives
- Learning what container orchestration is
- Learning what problems container orchestration solves
- Understanding (high-level) the K8s architecture

## Introduction: Brainstorming
- What is container orchestration?
- What problems does container orchestration solve?
- Let's name some common container orchestration tools.

## Kubernetes (K8s)
- So, what is Kubernetes (K8s)? Where does its name originate from?
- Let's discuss some of its main features.
- What are other things K8s can do?

## Practice: Answer the following
- Now that you know where K8s originates from, what does the ship wheel logo try to represent according to you?
- Where do applications (web servers, APIs...) run on a cluster?
- What moves containers around?

:grey_exclamation: Even though we haven't covered these yet, do your best with the time you have and do a bit of research. We'll see these concepts later on.

## The K8s Cluster
- So, what's a K8s cluster?
- Let's visit a basic (high-level) cluster architecture example.
- Control Plane (CP) and Worker Nodes (WNs)

## Practice: breakout rooms
Now that you've seen a very high-level overview of a K8s cluster, let's look a bit more closely at the different pieces that form it.

With the information and knowledge that you have right now, could you try to figure out (research is welcomed!) what's happening in the image above?

## Plenary
We'll now run and discuss through some of the things you found out in your research and link the pieces together.

Any questions?
