# Introduction to Container Orchestration with Kubernetes

## Learning Objectives

- Explain what container orchestration is
- Give examples of what common parts of the software development lifecycle container orchestration helps with
- Name the high-level components of a Kubernetes cluster
- Explain what purpose each of the high-level components of a Kubernetes cluster serves

## Container Orchestration

Let's build some intuitions.

- What is container orchestration?
- Why was it invented? What problems does container orchestration solve?
- What are some common container orchestration tools?

### Kubernetes (K8s)

Kubernetes is a very popular open-source system for container orchestration.
Some of the main features of Kubernetes are:
  - Automating deployments and rollbacks
  - Management of containerised applications
  - Scaling

Other things K8s can help with are:
  - Networking
  - Security
  - Configuration management

Let's have a look at how it achieves that.

## Practical

Do some research and answer the following:

- What does the ship wheel in the Kubernetes logo try to represent according to you?
- What is a Kubernetes cluster?
- Where do applications (e.g. web apps) run on a Kubernetes cluster?
- What part of the cluster is responsible for moving containers around?

Even though we haven't covered these yet, do your best with the time you have and do as bit of research.
We'll discuss these concepts afterwards.

## A bit more detail on Kubernetes

Now that you've seen a very high-level overview of a Kubernetes cluster, let's look a bit more closely at the different pieces that form it.
