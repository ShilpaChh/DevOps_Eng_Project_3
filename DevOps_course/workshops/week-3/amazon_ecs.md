# Amazon ECS

Amazon ECS is a fully managed Container Orchestration Service. It is a very popular service on AWS.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand how ECS and its different components work
- Launching first ECS sample app on AWS
- Introduction to Load Balancing

### Key Terminology
- Containers and Images
- Task Definition
- Task
- Cluster

### Practice: Launch Amazon ECS sample app

Your coach will launch a sample app provided by Amazon on ECS. Follow along using your existing knowledge about how ECS works and the different components that are part of it. This is what your coach will go through:

Navigate to `Elastic Container Service` on the **AWS Console > Services** and work through the steps. Some important things to bear in mind in the process of doing so:
- Pay attention to the diagrams in the different sections of the process. Could you identify and understand the key concepts that appeared?
- Finally, what is the **Application Load Balancer** Amazon is asking you about in the `Service` step? We'll discuss what's the purpose of it.

### What's next?

Now you know how to launch the ECS service using one of the example apps Amazon displays on the AWS Console. That's a great starting point!

After getting familiar with the service, clusters and tasks, among others, you could research and test in the future:
- Building your own custom image and pushing that one to Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
- Exploring how you could deploy that image to ECS
