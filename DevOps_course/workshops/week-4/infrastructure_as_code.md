# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

There is an increasing demand to deploy resources with tighter time constraints, all while maintaining formats and standards for environment configurations. Therefore, it is more and more common for companies to use products like Ansible, Chef, Puppet, and Terraform.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand how IaC works and its benefits
- Be able to explain a common IaC flow using Terraform

### Practice: link definitions to Terraform concepts

![Terraform flow terms](assets/infrastructure-as-code.jpg?raw=true "Terraform flow terms")

You will work in pairs to match the following concepts with each of the Terraform stages within the boxes:
- actions that Terraform will take to get to a desired state
- start infrastructure configuration project
- carry out current execution plan

:mag: Additionally, do some research in your pairs and answer the follownig questions:
- Is there a useful way in Terraform to check the formatting of your configuration files at any point in the Terraform flow? What would be that command?
- Is there a useful command to automatically fix any formatting issues in your config files if Terraform highlights there's something not following their standards? Could it be something on the lines of `eslint --fix`?
