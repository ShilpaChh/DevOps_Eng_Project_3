# Where is my server?

For this workshop, we'll examine the traditional architecture of a common UI-driven e-commerce site first to then think how we would design the same site but based on a serverless architecture.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the key ideas behind Serverless and the "Function as a Service" (FaaS) model
- Compare and contrast a Serverless cloud computing model with other cloud computing models
- Get more familiar with designing an application architecture based on real-world requirements
- Compare and contrast a Serverless application architecture with monolithic architectures

### Traditional three-tier architecture

### Practice: design what the website architecture would look like using a serverless architecture

For this exercise, you will be in teams to diagram the desired architecture using your current knowledge of serverless.
:bulb: You are encouraged to revisit the high-level architecture of the week project. However, this will need to be a bit more detailed as we need to take the following user stories into account:

```
As the online store manager
So that I know who is using the site
I would like the user to be authenticated to list or purchase items
```

```
As a user of Aragog Plants Ltd.
So that I can see which plants are available to buy
I would like to see a list of the available products
```

```
As a user of Aragog Plants Ltd.
So that I can buy one of the available plants
I would like to be able to purchase it on the website
```

### Examine and discuss both approaches: advantages and drawbacks

- The first example diagram could well describe the scenario of a containarised application. What are the advantages and drawbacks of using this model?
- The second example diagram focuses on a serverless architecture. What are the advantages and drawbacks?
