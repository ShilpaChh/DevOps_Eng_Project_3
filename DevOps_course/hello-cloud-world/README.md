# Hello Cloud World!

## Kick-off

1. We'll discuss the important things for the week.
2. Your coach will send you an invitation to join an AWS account owned by Makers Academy. Each of you will have their own user account on AWS. Note that this is the AWS sign-in that you will use for the rest of the course.
3. We'll have a short Q&A.
4. You'll get into your teams and run through the [project setup](#project-setup).
## Overview of the week
- You'll work in teams to build and deploy your first containerised application to the Cloud! (Your coach will announce the teams on Slack.)
- You'll organise your own work based on the goals for the week
- You will demo your group work during a session that will take place Friday
- There will be a retro on Friday

## Goals for the week

You are already familiar with these questions, but it's important to bear them in mind:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better DevOps engineer than you were yesterday?

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary questions:

**Containerisation**
* Can you explain the basics of how Docker works? In particular:
    * What a Docker container is
    * What a Docker image is
    * What containers are useful for
    * What a Dockerfile is used for
    * What Docker Hub is used for
* Can you use Docker to containerise a simple web app? In particular, can you:
    * Write a Dockerfile for a simple webapp
    * Use `docker` to build an image from a Dockerfile
    * Use `docker` to run a container from a Docker image


**Using the Cloud**
* Can you illustrate a deployment process using a diagram?
* Can you follow an effective process for learning to use a new Cloud service?
* Can you deploy a containerised web app to AWS?
* Can you gain visibility into your deployed application using *logging* and *telemetry*?

### Project Setup

1. Create a GitLab repo for your Hello Cloud World! project. Make sure you create it inside the GitLab sub-group that your coach will point you to (it will be named after your cohort). 
2. Add the other members of your group as collaborators.
3. Create a simple webapp server using either Flask (this is the Python option) or Express (this is the Javascript option). Choose the language and framework in which you would feel most comfortable writing a very simple webapp. It need not do more than show "Hello World" in a browser window.
4. Once you've created the app, move on to the [specification](specification.md) to find out to where you should deploy your app.
